As a branch of the Microstructure Builder software package, CA Builder
essentially utilizes Cellular Automaton to grow nuclei with specific
aspect ratios in place of synopsis. CA can easily generate elongated
microstructures typically seen in uniaxially deformed metals.
 
Additional codes have been implemented to generate specific
file formats which can be directly read into the ADD_TEXTURE software.
The end result is a discrete microstructure and corresponding texture that
statistically resembles the experimentally observed microstructure
characteristics.
