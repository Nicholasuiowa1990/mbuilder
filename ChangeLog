	* Created stat3d_v2.f90 to generate the XML file
          for large structures where the dimensions are >= 500^3 
	* Generated XML_texture_check.f to calculate MDF and ODF
	  of large datasets (>=500^3)

6/11/07 Chris Roberts
	* added spin_renumberMC.f to move spins from 0 to Q-1 to
	  1 to Q. Updates EAorts.txt also.

6/7/07  Chris Roberts
	* Added wts2ang.f90 to convert WTS file to an ANG file
          format used by TSL software.
 	* corrected a bug in the MC_mdf_check.f. did not account
          for grain ID=0

4/19/07 Chris Roberts
	* Updated stat3d.f to correct issues with time values < 10	

4/17/07 Chris Roberts
	* Updated generate-3d.sh
	* Modified annealfinal.c to exit loop when error drops
	  below a minimum threshold (MINERROR) to reduce computational
	  time.

4/15/07 Chris Roberts
	* corrected stat3d.f -- subroutine neighs() was assigning
	  values outside of box
        * added to the cell_auto package on SVN
        * updated generate-3d.sh to run recursivesampler and ellipticalFoam
          to generate the nuclei and aspect ratios for CA code.
        * modified myCA_v10.f to read elliptical.cells and active.list
          to generate the correct microstructure

3/5/07  Chris Roberts
	* edited generate-3d.sh to pre-determine ave grain volume
	* updated README
	* fixed myCA.f to read ellipsoid.info

2/27/07 Chris Roberts
	* added bell_curve.pl which creates a standard log-normal
          grain size distribution

2/19/07 Chris Roberts
       	* fixed RodToE_wts.c and rod2eul.f to properly weight each
          discrete orientation.

2/8/07  Chris Roberts
 	* fixed rod2eul.f to correctly weight the discrete orientations

2/1/07  Chris Roberts
  	* added code to convert the photo file to a Paraview format
        * added a code to calculate the digital microstructure's
          MDF and ODF
        * updated generate-3d.sh

1/12/07 Chris Roberts
        * added Sintay's texlist.c program to replace the annealfinal.c
        * modified mdfextract and odfextract to read all ANG files
        * modified generate-3d.sh to create new directory for each
          structure generated in the OUTPUT_FILES/ directory 

1/5/07	Chris Roberts
	* replaced ellipticalfoam.c, synopsis, makeperiodic, findpoints
          with a CA code to generate a microstructure on a rectilinear grid
	* wrote Makefile to compile all C,C++, and F source
	* wrote shell script to reduce user intervention during 
          microstructure generation
